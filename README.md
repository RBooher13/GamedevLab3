# GamedevLab3
Name: ZOOmerang

Intent: To entertain and educate with fun facts about animals with the added goal of becoming more familiar with Unity.

Narrative Structure: The player plays as a robot with a jetpack navigating itself around a simple, hand-drawn world. It can interact with zoo animals and boomerangs all over the place.

Mechanics: The player uses the keyboard to control a character and interact with objects in the game.

Aesthetics: The game has a hand-drawn/pixelated feel. It takes place on a piece of paper and the characters and interactable objects have a hand-drawn look.

Joys and struggles: Implementing the parallax background was easy and interesting and coming up with the concept for the game was fun. We had a fair number of merge conflicts throughout the process of making this game, however, that made it very difficult to complete some of our work satisfactorily.

Contributions: Noah worked mostly on designing/implementing the physical world of the game including the platforms and interactable objects. Rhett created the menus for the game and implemented the parallax background.
